    <p>My name is Dee Ann Scanniello. I was born in South Dakota, and raised
        in Anaconda, Montana. Once I graducated high school I moved to Phoenix, AZ
        to go to DeVry University to earn a degree as an Electronics Engineer. While
        going to school there I worked at ABC Diaper servie washing and folding
        dirty baby diapers. But, as life would have it, a degree in Electronic
        Engineering wasn't happening due to financial difficulties, so I had to
        drop out of school and went to work for FotoMat.  After waiting 2 years or
        so I finally made a decision to go back to school and went to Miller
        Institue were I got my diploma as an Electronic Technician. After graduating
        I went work for Tegal Corporation. A semiconductor Etching equipment company
        as a Field Service Engineer.
    </p>

    <p>I worked in the Semiconductor industry for approximately 15 years, eventually
        moving my way up to a Process Technician position.  This was a very rewarding
        job, as I was able to design experiments and come up with processed to actually
        use in the manufacturing process of making the semiconductors. I would write
        up the specifications for the process procedures, maintenance procedures, and 
        operator procedures and tests.
